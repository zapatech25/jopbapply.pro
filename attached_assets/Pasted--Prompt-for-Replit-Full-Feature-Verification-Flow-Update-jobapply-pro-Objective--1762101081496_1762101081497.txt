       - If **Yes:** Proceed to £39 enhancement payment, then resume.
       - If **No:** Proceed to Job Role Selection.

4. **Job Role Selection**
   - User selects up to **4–5 roles** from a **dropdown list** (populated by admin).

### **Step 3 – Actions for Replit**

1. Identify all currently working features from the above checklist.  
2. Identify missing or incomplete features.

4. Apply all necessary backend and frontend updates so the full flow works end-to-end as described.  
5. Ensure all changes are persistent in production, not preview-only.  
6. Test all flows (registration, payment, CV upload, admin management, CSV upload, dashboard reporting).
