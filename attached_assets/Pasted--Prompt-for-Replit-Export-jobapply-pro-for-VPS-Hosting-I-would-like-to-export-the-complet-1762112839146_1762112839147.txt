### 🧭 Prompt for Replit – Export jobapply.pro for VPS Hosting

I would like to **export the complete jobapply.pro application** from Replit so that it can be hosted on my **own VPS server** instead of Replit’s environment.  

Please do the following in full detail:

---

### **1️⃣ Generate a Deployment Export Package**
- Prepare the project for external deployment:
  - Include all backend, frontend, and configuration files.
  - Ensure `.env` variables are clearly defined and listed (but not exposed — show placeholder keys like `YOUR_DB_URL_HERE`, etc.).
  - Include any `build` or `dist` directories required for production.
  - Remove all Replit-specific or internal paths.

---

### **2️⃣ Document Environment & Dependencies**
Please produce a **step-by-step deployment guide** tailored for a **Ubuntu 22.04 VPS** environment:
- Required dependencies (Node.js, npm/yarn, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- How to set up `.env` file and environment variables
- How to initialise and migrate the database (if applicable)
- Commands to build the frontend and start the backend (e.g., `npm run build`, `npm start`)
- Ports that need to be open (e.g., 80/443)
- Instructions for running the app as a background service using **PM2** or **systemd**

---

### **3️⃣ Generate Docker Support (Optional but Preferred)**
If possible, please generate:
- A production-ready **Dockerfile**
- A **docker-compose.yml** (if there are multiple services such as backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL)
- All environment variables mapped in `.env.example`

---

### **4️⃣ Prepare Database Migration Scripts**
- Export all SQL schema migrations or `drizzle`/`prisma`/`sequelize` migration files (depending on the ORM used)
- Include clear instructions on how to initialise the database schema on my VPS

---

### **5️⃣ Provide Clear Deployment Instructions**
Once the package is ready:
- Summarise how to deploy on a VPS step-by-step
  - Clone repository or upload exported ZIP
  - Set up `.env`
  - Run build and start commands
  - Optional: configure NGINX reverse proxy for domain + SSL
- Mention any paths or configs that might differ between Replit and my VPS

---

### **6️⃣ Deliverables**
At the end, please provide:
- Download link (or zip file) of the full production-ready project
- `.env.example`
- Deployment commands summary
- Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml (if created)
- Notes on where to adjust for VPS hosting (domain, DB, etc.)

---

**Goal:**  
I need to host jobapply.pro on my own VPS with the same behaviour as on Replit.  
Please prepare everything necessary for me to run the app independently and reliably in production.
