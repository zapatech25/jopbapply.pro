The signup form on jobapply.pro currently only accepts email and password. Please make the following critical updates and fixes to ensure the user authentication and profile management system is complete and stable:

1️⃣ **Signup Form Expansion**
- Add fields for: Full Name, Mobile Number (with validation), Email Address, and Password.
- All fields should be required.
- Save these details properly to the users table in the database.
- Ensure form validation is in place both on frontend and backend (e.g., valid email, phone number, password strength).
- Display clear error/success messages for each field.

2️⃣ **Forgot Password Feature**
- Implement a “Forgot Password?” link on the login page.
- When clicked, it should allow users to reset their password securely via email verification (OTP or token link).
- Add an endpoint and UI flow for resetting passwords.
- Ensure this flow works seamlessly in both production and preview environments.

3️⃣ **User Profile Page**
- Create a “My Profile” section accessible after login.
- Allow users to:
  - View and edit their Full Name, Mobile Number, and Email Address.
  - Change their Password securely.
  - Upload a profile picture (optional, if time allows).
- Include frontend and backend validation for all editable fields.
- Ensure all changes are updated in real time in the database.

4️⃣ **CSV Upload Error Fix**
- Currently, uploading a CSV to update a user's application dashboard throws the error: `CSV validation failed`.
- Investigate this issue thoroughly:
  - Check the backend CSV parser for missing header mappings or schema mismatch.
  - Ensure uploaded CSV files are validated correctly before processing (e.g., required columns: Application ID, Job Title, Status, Date Applied, etc.).
  - Implement clear error feedback when a CSV upload fails.
  - Fix the logic so that valid CSVs update user dashboards correctly.

5️⃣ **Testing & Validation**
- Test the full authentication flow (signup → login → forgot password → profile update).
- Test CSV upload end-to-end to confirm it updates the dashboard without validation errors.
- Provide admin credentials or logs to verify all changes work correctly.

🎯 **Goal:** Ensure that users can fully manage their profiles, recover passwords, and admins/users can upload CSVs without validation errors. All changes must be saved and reflected accurately in the live environment (https://jobapply.pro).

Once all is complete, confirm the fixes have been tested and provide the new admin credentials for production verification.
