# Replit AI Prompt — Phase 1: JobApply.pro MVP

## Project Name
JobApply.pro — Phase 1 MVP

## Objective
Build a job application platform with the following features:

1. **User Authentication & Roles**
   - Users can register and login
   - Roles: `user`, `admin` (admin access to manage plans and CSV uploads)
   - JWT or session-based auth (your choice of implementation)
   - Protect admin routes; users cannot access admin functions

2. **Plans Catalogue**
   - Seeded plans:
     - TRIAL_10 → 10 applications, £9
     - APPS_150 → 150 applications, £79
     - APPS_300 → 300 applications, £139
     - APPS_500 → 500 applications, £199
     - APPS_1000 → 1000 applications, £349
     - CV_RETOUCH → service-only, £39
   - Rules:
     - Every 150 application credits = 7 calendar days processing
   - Admin can create/edit/deactivate plans
   - Public pricing page displays active plans with CTA buttons

3. **Frontend Pages**
   - `/register` → registration form
   - `/login` → login form
   - `/pricing` → plan listing
   - All pages should be mobile-first and fully responsive

4. **CSV Upload (Phase 1 placeholder)**
   - Admin can upload CSV files to populate application statuses for each user (per-user, not general)

5. **Dashboard (Phase 1 placeholder)**
   - Users see which plans they purchased and credits remaining
   - Placeholder for future application status view

6. **Design & UI**
   - Colour scheme: **blue (#0077FF), green (#22C55E), white (#FFFFFF), black (#111827), gray (#F3F4F6)**
   - Clean, modern, intuitive, professional yet approachable
   - Buttons, cards, forms, and layout should reflect this palette
   - Mobile-first design is a core priority
   - Use modern typography and spacing

7. **Stack & Structure**
   - Replit AI is free to choose the tech stack (frontend + backend) and folder structure
   - Ensure modularity for easy expansion in future phases

8. **Functionality Summary**
   - Auth routes: register, login, get current user
   - Plans routes: get public plans, admin CRUD operations
   - Seed plans with correct SKUs and pricing
   - Frontend forms: register, login, pricing cards with CTA buttons
   - Placeholder for dashboard and CSV upload functionality

## Deliverables
- A fully functioning Phase 1 MVP of `jobapply.pro`
- Authentication and roles fully implemented
- Public pricing page with active plans
- Admin CRUD for plans
- Mobile-first, responsive UI matching colour palette
- Code ready to extend for next phases (dashboard, CSV uploads, batch logic)

# Additional Notes for Replit AI
- You may use React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS for frontend
- You may use Node.js/Express, Fastify, Django, Flask, or any backend you choose
- Styling should match the colour palette and modern design tone
- Ensure all pages are responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Generate placeholder data where necessary to simulate plans and users
- Comments in code should explain where next phase features will integrate
